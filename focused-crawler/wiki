 Pokémon [a]  ( English:  / ˈ p oʊ k ɪ ˌ m ɒ n ,   - k i -,   - k eɪ -/ ), [1] [2] [3]  also known as  Pocket Monsters [b]  in Japan, is a Japanese  media franchise  managed by  the Pokémon Company , a company founded and with shares divided between  Nintendo ,  Game Freak , and  Creatures . [4]  The franchise copyright and Japanese  trademark  is shared by all three companies, [5]  but  Nintendo  is the sole owner of the trademark in other countries. [6]  The franchise was created by  Satoshi Tajiri  in 1995, [7]  and is centered on fictional creatures called  "Pokémon" , which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport. The English  slogan  for the franchise is " Gotta Catch 'Em All ". [8] [9]  Works within the franchise are set in the  Pokémon universe .
 The franchise began as  Pokémon Red  and  Green  (later released outside of Japan as  Pokémon Red  and  Blue ), a pair of video games for the original  Game Boy  handheld system that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996. It soon became a  media mix  franchise adapted into various different media. [10]   Pokémon  has since gone on to become the  highest-grossing media franchise  of all time, [11] [12] [13]  with  $90 billion  in total franchise revenue. [14] [15]  The  original video game series  is the second  best-selling video game franchise  (behind Nintendo's  Mario  franchise ) [16]  with more than 346   million copies sold [17]  and 1   billion  mobile downloads , [18]  and it spawned a hit  anime television series  that has become the most successful  video game adaptation [19]  with  over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes  in 169 countries. [17]  In addition, the  Pokémon  franchise includes the world's top-selling toy brand, [20]  the  top-selling trading card game [21]  with over 28.8   billion cards sold, [17]  an  anime film series , a  live-action film ,  books ,  manga comics ,  music , merchandise, and  a theme park . The franchise is also represented in other Nintendo media, such as the  Super Smash Bros.  series.
 In November 2005,  4Kids Entertainment , which had managed the non-game related licensing of  Pokémon , announced that it had agreed not to renew the  Pokémon  representation agreement. The Pokémon Company International oversees all  Pokémon  licensing outside Asia. [22]  In 2006, the franchise celebrated  its tenth anniversary . [23]  In 2016, the Pokémon Company celebrated  Pokémon ' s 20th anniversary by airing an ad during  Super Bowl 50  in January and issuing re-releases of the 1996 Game Boy games  Pokémon Red, Green  (only in Japan), and  Blue,  and the 1998 Game Boy Color game  Pokémon Yellow  for the  Nintendo 3DS  on February 26, 2016. [24] [25]  The mobile  augmented reality  game  Pokémon Go  was released in July 2016. [26]  The first live-action film in the franchise,  Pokémon Detective Pikachu , based on the 2018 Nintendo 3DS spinoff game  Detective Pikachu , was released in 2019. [11]  The most recently released games,  Pokémon Sword and Shield , were released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on November 15, 2019. [27]

 Name 
 The name  Pokémon  is the  portmanteau  of the Japanese brand  Pocket Monsters . [28]  The term "Pokémon", in addition to referring to the  Pokémon  franchise itself, also collectively refers to the  890 fictional species  that have made appearances in  Pokémon  media as of the release of the eighth generation titles  Pokémon Sword and Shield . "Pokémon" is  identical in the singular and plural , as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one  Pikachu " and "many Pikachu". [29] 
 
 Concept 
 See also:  Gameplay of Pokémon  and  List of Pokémon 
 Pokémon  executive director  Satoshi Tajiri  first thought of  Pokémon , albeit with a different concept and name, around 1989, when the  Game Boy  was released. The concept of the  Pokémon universe , in both the video games and the general fictional world of  Pokémon , stems from the hobby of  insect collecting , a popular pastime which Tajiri enjoyed as a child. [30]  Players are designated as  Pokémon Trainers  and have three general goals: to complete the regional  Pokédex  by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place, to complete the national Pokédex by transferring Pokémon from other regions, and to train a team of powerful Pokémon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers so they may eventually win the Pokémon League and become the regional Champion. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the Pokémon franchise, including the  video games , the  anime  and manga series, and the  Pokémon Trading Card Game .
 In most incarnations of the Pokémon universe, a Trainer who encounters a wild Pokémon is able to capture that Pokémon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a  Poké Ball  at it. If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the Poké Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pokémon would rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pokémon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokémon; if the opposing Pokémon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokémon with a Poké Ball, increasing their collection of creatures. In  Pokémon Go , and in  Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!  and  Let's Go, Eevee! , wild Pokémon encountered by players can be caught in Poké Balls, but generally cannot be battled. Pokémon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain side games. If a Pokémon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out ("faints"), the winning Pokémon gains  experience points  and may  level up . Beginning with  Pokémon X  and  Y , experience points are also gained from catching Pokémon in Poké Balls. When leveling up, the Pokémon's battling aptitude statistics (" stats ", such as "Attack" and "Speed") increase. At certain levels, the Pokémon may also learn new  moves , which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pokémon can undergo a form of  metamorphosis  and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pokémon, a process called  evolution ; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series. Some species of Pokémon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all. For example, the Pokémon Pichu may evolve into Pikachu, which in turn may evolve into Raichu, following which no further evolutions may occur.  Pokémon X  and  Y  introduced the concept of "Mega Evolution," by which certain fully evolved Pokémon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, is reversible.
 In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to raise a team of Pokémon to defeat many  non-player character  (NPC) Trainers and their Pokémon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the  Pokémon  world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way (including foiling the plans of an 'evil' team of Pokémon Trainers who serve as antagonists to the player). Excluding  Pokémon Sun  and  Moon  and  Pokémon Ultra Sun  and  Ultra Moon , the games feature eight powerful Trainers, referred to as  Gym Leaders , that the Trainer must defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, the Trainer is eligible to challenge the region's Pokémon League, where four talented trainers (referred to collectively as the " Elite Four ") challenge the Trainer to four Pokémon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, they must challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new champion.

 All of the licensed  Pokémon  properties overseen by  the Pokémon Company International  are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly  chronological  divisions by release; every several years, when a sequel to the 1996  role-playing video games   Pokémon Red  and  Green  is released that features new Pokémon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The  main  Pokémon  video games  and their spin-offs, the anime, manga, and trading card game are all updated with the new Pokémon properties each time a new generation begins. [32]  Some Pokémon from the newer games appear in anime episodes or films months, or even years, before the game they were programmed for came out. The first generation began in Japan with  Pokémon Red  and  Green  on the Game Boy. As of 2020, there currently are eight generations of main series video games. The most recent games in the main series,  Pokémon Sword  and  Shield , began the eighth and latest generation and were released worldwide for the Nintendo Switch on November 15, 2019.

 Pokémon  CDs have been released in North America, some of them in conjunction with the theatrical releases of the first three and the 20th  Pokémon  films. These releases were commonplace until late 2001. On March 27, 2007, a tenth anniversary CD was released containing 18 tracks from the English dub; this was the first English-language release in over five years.

 Pokémon Trading Card Game 
 Main article:  Pokémon Trading Card Game 
   Palkia , the Spacial Pokémon  Trading Card Game  card from  Pokémon TCG Diamond and Pearl .  The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) is a  collectible card game  with a goal similar to a Pokémon battle in the video game series. Players use Pokémon cards, with individual strengths and weaknesses, in an attempt to defeat their opponent by "knocking out" their Pokémon cards. [55]  The game was published in North America by  Wizards of the Coast  in 1999. [56]  With the release of the  Game Boy Advance  video games  Pokémon Ruby  and  Sapphire , the Pokémon Company took back the card game from Wizards of the Coast and started publishing the cards themselves. [56]  The Expedition expansion introduced the  Pokémon-e Trading Card Game , where the cards (for the most part) were compatible with the  Nintendo e-Reader . Nintendo discontinued its production of e-Reader compatible cards with the release of  FireRed  and  LeafGreen . In 1998, Nintendo released a Game Boy Color version of the trading card game in Japan;  Pokémon Trading Card Game  was subsequently released to the US and Europe in 2000. The game included digital versions cards from the original set of cards and the first two expansions (Jungle and Fossil), as well as several cards exclusive to the game. A sequel was released in Japan in 2001. [57] 
 Manga

 Criticism and controversy 
 Morality and religious beliefs 
 Pokémon  has been criticized by some fundamentalist Christians over perceived  occult  and  violent  themes and the concept of "Pokémon evolution", which they feel goes against the Biblical creation account in Genesis. [73]   Sat2000 , a satellite television station based in  Vatican City , has countered that the Pokémon Trading Card Game and video games are "full of inventive imagination" and have no "harmful moral side effects". [74] [75]  In the United Kingdom, the "Christian Power Cards" game was introduced in 1999 by David Tate who stated, "Some people aren't happy with Pokémon and want an alternative, others just want Christian games." The game was similar to the Pokémon Trading Card Game but used Biblical figures. [76] 
 In 1999, Nintendo stopped manufacturing the Japanese version of the "Koga's Ninja Trick" trading card because it depicted a  manji , a traditionally  Buddhist  symbol with no negative connotations. The  Jewish  civil rights group  Anti-Defamation League  complained because the symbol is the reverse of a  swastika , a  Nazi  symbol. The cards were intended for sale in Japan only, but the popularity of  Pokémon  led to import into the United States with approval from Nintendo. The Anti-Defamation League understood that the portrayed symbol was not intended to offend and acknowledged the sensitivity that Nintendo showed by removing the product. [77] [78] 
 In 1999, two nine-year-old boys from  Merrick , New York sued Nintendo because they claimed the Pokémon Trading Card Game caused their  problematic gambling . [79] 
 In 2001,  Saudi Arabia  banned  Pokémon  games and the trading cards, alleging that the franchise promoted  Zionism  by displaying the  Star of David  in the trading cards (a six-pointed star is featured in the card game) as well as other religious symbols such as  crosses  they associated with Christianity and triangles they associated with  Freemasonry ; the games also involved gambling, which is in violation of  Muslim  doctrine. [80] [81] 
 Pokémon  has also been accused of promoting  materialism . [82] 
 
 Animal cruelty 
 In 2012,  PETA  criticized the concept of  Pokémon  as supporting  cruelty to animals . PETA compared the game's concept, of capturing animals and forcing them to fight, to  cockfights ,  dog fighting  rings and circuses, events frequently criticized for cruelty to animals. PETA released a game spoofing  Pokémon  where the Pokémon battle their trainers to win their freedom. [83]  PETA reaffirmed their objections in 2016 with the release of  Pokémon Go , promoting the hashtag #GottaFreeThemAll. [84] 
 
 Health 
 Main article:  Dennō Senshi Porygon 
 See also:  Burger King Pokémon container recall 
 On December 16, 1997, more than 635 Japanese children were admitted to hospitals with epileptic  seizures . [85]  It was determined the seizures were caused by watching an episode of Pokémon " Dennō Senshi Porygon ", (most commonly translated "Electric Soldier Porygon", season 1, episode 38); as a result, this episode has not been aired since. In this particular episode, there were bright explosions with rapidly alternating blue and red color patterns. [86]  It was determined in subsequent research that these strobing light effects cause some individuals to have epileptic seizures, even if the person had no previous history of  epilepsy . [87]  This incident is a common focus of Pokémon-related parodies in other media, and was lampooned by  The Simpsons  episode " Thirty Minutes over Tokyo " [88]  and the  South Park  episode " Chinpokomon ", [89]  among others.
 
 Monster in My Pocket 
 In March 2000, Morrison Entertainment Group, a toy developer based at  Manhattan Beach, California , sued Nintendo over claims that  Pokémon  infringed on its own  Monster in My Pocket  characters. A judge ruled there was no infringement and Morrison appealed the ruling. On February 4, 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision by the District Court to dismiss the suit. [90] 
 
 Pokémon Go 
 See also:  Pokémon Go § Criticism and incidents 
 Within its first two days of release,  Pokémon Go  raised safety concerns among players. Multiple people also suffered minor injuries from falling while playing the game due to being distracted. [91] 
 Multiple police departments in various countries have issued warnings, some  tongue-in-cheek , regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one's surroundings. [92] [93]  People have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game, [94] [95] [96] [97]  and Bosnian players have been warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s  Bosnian War . [98]  On July 20, 2016, it was reported that an 18-year-old boy in  Chiquimula ,  Guatemala  was shot and killed while playing the game in the late evening hours. This was the first reported death in connection with the app. The boy's 17-year-old cousin, who was accompanying the victim, was shot in the foot. Police speculated that the shooters used the game's GPS capability to find the two. [99] 
 
 Cultural influence 
   All Nippon Airways   Boeing 747-400  in Pokémon livery, dubbed a  Pokémon Jet . 
 Pokémon , being a globally popular franchise, has left a significant mark on today's  popular culture . The  Pokémon  characters  have become pop culture icons; examples include two different Pikachu balloons in the  Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade ,  Pokémon -themed airplanes operated by All Nippon Airways, merchandise items, and a  traveling theme park  that was in  Nagoya, Japan  in 2005 and in  Taipei  in 2006.  Pokémon  also appeared on the cover of the U.S. magazine  Time  in 1999. [100]  The Comedy Central show  Drawn Together  has a character named  Ling-Ling  who is a parody of Pikachu. [101]  Several other shows such as  The Simpsons , [102]   South Park [103]  and  Robot Chicken [104]  have made references and spoofs of  Pokémon , among other series.  Pokémon  was featured on  VH1 's  I Love the '90s: Part Deux . A live action show based on the anime called  Pokémon Live!  toured the United States in late 2000. [105]   Jim Butcher  cites  Pokémon  as one of the inspirations for the  Codex Alera  series of novels. [106] 
 Pokémon has even made its mark in the realm of science. This includes animals named after Pokémon, such as  Stentorceps weedlei  (named after the Pokémon Weedle for its resemblance) and  Chilicola Charizard Monckton  (named after the Pokémon  Charizard ). [107]  There is also a protein named after Pikachu, called  Pikachurin .
 In November 2001, Nintendo opened a store called the Pokémon Center in New York, in  Rockefeller Center , [108]  modeled after the two other Pokémon Center stores in Tokyo and  Osaka  and named after a staple of the video game series. Pokémon Centers are fictional buildings where Trainers take their injured Pokémon to be healed after combat. [109]  The store sold Pokémon merchandise on a total of two floors, with items ranging from collectible shirts to stuffed Pokémon  plushies . [110]  The store also featured a Pokémon Distributing Machine in which players would place their game to receive an egg of a Pokémon that was being given out at that time. The store also had tables that were open for players of the Pokémon Trading Card Game to duel each other or an employee. The store was closed and replaced by the  Nintendo World Store  on May 14, 2005. [111]  Four Pokémon Center kiosks were put in malls in the Seattle area. [112]  The Pokémon Center online store was relaunched on August 6, 2014. [113] 
 
   Meitetsu  2200 series train  Giratina & Shaymin . 
 Professor of Education  Joseph Tobin  theorizes that the success of the franchise was due to the long list of names that could be learned by children and repeated in their peer groups. Its rich fictional universe provides opportunities for discussion and demonstration of knowledge in front of their peers. The names of the creatures were linked to its characteristics, which converged with the children's belief that names have symbolic power. Children can pick their favourite Pokémon and affirm their individuality while at the same time affirming their conformance to the values of the group, and they can distinguish themselves from others by asserting what they liked and what they did not like from every chapter.  Pokémon  gained popularity because it provides a sense of identity to a wide variety of children, and lost it quickly when many of those children found that the identity groups were too big and searched for identities that would distinguish them into smaller groups. [114] 
 
   Shinkansen E3 Series  train in Pokémon livery. 
 Pokémon ' s history has been marked at times by rivalry with the  Digimon  media franchise that debuted at a similar time. Described as "the other 'mon'" by  IGN 's Juan Castro,  Digimon  has not enjoyed  Pokémon ' s level of international popularity or success, but has maintained a dedicated fanbase. [115]  IGN's Lucas M. Thomas stated that  Pokémon  is  Digimon ' s "constant competition and comparison", attributing the former's relative success to the simplicity of its evolution mechanic as opposed to  Digivolution . [116]  The two have been noted for conceptual and stylistic similarities by sources such as GameZone. [117]  A debate among fans exists over which of the two franchises came first. [118]  In actuality, the first  Pokémon  media,  Pokémon Red  and  Green , were released initially on February 27, 1996; [119]  whereas the  Digimon  virtual pet  was released on June 26, 1997.
 
 Fan community 
 While  Pokémon ' s target demographic is children, early purchasers of  Pokémon Omega Ruby  and  Alpha Sapphire  were in their 20s. [120]  Many fans are adults who originally played the games as children and had later returned to the series. [121] 
 Numerous  fan sites  exist for the Pokémon franchise, including  Bulbapedia , a  wiki -based encyclopedia, [122] [123] [124]  and Serebii, [125]  a news and reference website. [126]  Other large fan communities exist on other platforms, such as the r/pokemon  subreddit  with over 2.2 million subscribers. [127] 
 A  significant community around the  Pokémon  video games' metagame  has existed for a long time, analyzing the best ways to use each Pokémon to their full potential in competitive battles. The most prolific competitive community is Smogon University, which has created a widely accepted tier-based battle system. [128] 
Smogon is affiliated with an online  Pokémon  game called  Pokémon Showdown , in which players create a team and battle against other players around the world using the competitive tiers created by Smogon. [129] 
 In early 2014, an anonymous video streamer on  Twitch  launched  Twitch Plays  Pokémon , an experiment trying to  crowdsource  playing subsequent  Pokémon  games, starting with  Pokémon Red . [130] [131] 
 A challenge called the Nuzlocke Challenge was created in order for older players of the series to enjoy  Pokémon  again—but with a twist. The player is only allowed to capture the first Pokémon encountered in each area. If they do not succeed in capturing that Pokémon, there are no second chances. When a Pokémon faints, it is considered "dead" and must be released or stored in the PC permanently. [132]  If the player faints, the game is considered over, and the player must restart. [133]  The original idea consisted of 2 to 3 rules that the community has built upon. There are many  fan made   Pokémon  games that contain a  game mode  similar to the Nuzlocke Challenge, such as  Pokémon Uranium . [134] 
 A study at Stanford Neurosciences published in  Nature  performed magnetic resonance imaging scans of 11 Pokémon experts and 11 controls, finding that seeing Pokémon stimulated activity in the visual cortex, in a different place than is triggered by recognizing faces, places or words, demonstrating the brain's ability to create such specialized areas. [135]
