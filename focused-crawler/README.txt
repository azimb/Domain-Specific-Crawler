Project description: This project implements a domain specific search engine that crawls, 
indexes and presents results for a specific domain in Python 3.6.0.

Running and testing instructions: 
	- Navigate to the src directory within the project.
	- Run the following commands in the terminal.
	- pip install -r requirements.txt
	- python domain-specific-crawler.py
	- The application will prompt the user to input a search domain and the number of pages to crawl.
	- The crawl will begin (will take some time), once completed a browser window will open displaying relevant URLs.
*The ouput of the crawl is also saved within the /src directory as crawl-output.html*
